/**
 * @file oracool/hud_art.h
 *
 * Oracool: user request - HUD overhaul art pass. Loads the user-supplied HUD art (the middle HUD
 * plate and the Health/Mana orb compositions, assets/ui/*.png) and draws them as the new HUD.
 *
 * The engine renders to an 8-bit palettized surface, so each 32-bit PNG is quantized to palette
 * indices on first draw. Quantization deliberately uses only the GLOBAL half of the palette
 * (entries 128-255 - see engine/palette.h: "Entry 128-255 are global"), which is identical across
 * town and every dungeon type, so one quantization pass works everywhere and never hits the
 * level-specific/color-cycled 0-127 range. Matching runs against orig_palette (NOT logical_palette,
 * which still holds the loading screen's cutscene palette when the first frame draws - see the
 * bug postmortem in hud_art.cpp), and everything requantizes automatically if the global palette
 * half ever actually changes.
 *
 * The orbs get a drain effect: a darkened variant of each composition - dimmed only inside the
 * orb's sphere circle, so the statue/frame art stays lit - is drawn as the base, and the bright
 * version is revealed bottom-up across the sphere's vertical span proportionally to current
 * HP/mana. One source image per orb is enough; the empty state is generated, not authored.
